# How to learn a (possible any) language based on the hypothesis of Comprehensible Input

There is arguably a line of research and a series of personal stories that show that language learning is primarily a subconscious activity. Therefore, the techniques for acquiring a new language should focus for the most part (some say 80-90%) on comprehensible input (reading texts, luckily this includes subtitles in movies and series) supported (but not dominated by) explicit grammar and language structure learning. Many self-taught foreign-language-as-native speakers refer to this resource

* Interview of Matt with Stephen Krashen
  * Matt has learned Japanese in about 4-5 years to a an almost native level by **self-study**
  * Stephen Krashen is a recognized expert on language acquisition
* Talking about importance of comprehensible input for language learning as language learning happens (mostly) in subconscious level

* Learned Spanish to strong B2 level in 10 months by (mostly) self-study
* Time dedication: for something like ~8months 30mins a day ONLY

* moving to a country where your target language is spoken just makes things easier:
  * it motivates your more
  * you constantly hear it all around
  * flashcards with words
  * carry a notebook to write down the words you don't know
  * write down the words that you know in your native language but not in the target language
  * using `memrise`
  * read books
  * don't worry about understanding each word!
    * there is scientific research about it
    * worry about the general understanding only
  * avoid english speakers (yeah, i kinda disagree, do not stress yourself)

* Luke Truman. Learned Cantonese and learning Spanish now
  * Do not spend time on podcasts
    * they give you "illusion of learning". After finishing a podcast you think "oh cool, I've learned something", but you can not remember anything
  * Do not spend too much time on learning beginner stuff. Move on to more challenging topics
  * Started learning Cantonese after work, but was so tired that it did not bring anything. So he thought: "fuck it, if I am gonna dedicate my time to something, then something better come out of it"
    * carved out 30 mins in the morning, full focused time. Non-negotiable every single day
  * being very very selective about the phrases that he thought are important
    * putting them down into Anki
    * Too much Anki is bad
  * as long you don't quit and KEEP your EYES open, you will get there and arrive at the right conclusion
    * Denis: I think it applies to math too
  * Luke learned a lot from other experts (Olli, his friend, and Steve the polyglot and creator of lingq)
  * A lot of it is psychology. If you do not stop, you cannot fail
  * Try and enjoy the process
  * The better you get the easier it gets to get even better. But the value of each new word, which are easier to learn when you are good, diminishes
  * Luke has hired translator (from English to Cantonese) and a person who'd voice this translation
    * the good thing is that if you study a language that does not has limited resources for learning you can get your money back by selling the translated and voiced stuff back to people
  * Good balance: non-negotiable 1 hour but then having time in the evening to enjoy life with his mates
  * If you watch TV, just watch it in the target language. Do not add it on top

* Motivation
* Get a book and read it (especially what you've already read in your native language)
* Force yourself to learn every day (it's very painful and embarrassing)
* Mistakes are good
